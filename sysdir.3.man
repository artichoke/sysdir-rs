sysdir(3)                  Library Functions Manual                  sysdir(3)

NAME
     sysdir_start_search_path_enumeration,
     sysdir_get_next_search_path_enumeration â€“ Enumeration of the filesystem
     paths for the various standard system directories where apps, resources,
     etc. get installed.

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sysdir.h>

     sysdir_search_path_enumeration_state
     sysdir_start_search_path_enumeration(sysdir_search_path_directory_t dir,
         sysdir_search_path_domain_mask_t domainMask);

     sysdir_search_path_enumeration_state
     sysdir_get_next_search_path_enumeration(sysdir_search_path_enumeration_state state,
         char *path);

DESCRIPTION
     The sysdir API returns the various standard system directories where
     apps, resources, etc. get installed. Because queries can return multiple
     directories, the API is in the form of an enumeration. The directories
     are returned in search path order: that is, the first place to look is
     returned first.

     sysdir_start_search_path_enumeration() begins enumeration of the
     filesystem paths for the specified directory and domain(s).  The return
     value should be passed to one or more calls to
     sysdir_get_next_search_path_enumeration() to obtain the filesystem path
     and continue the enumeration.

     sysdir_get_next_search_path_enumeration() returns a filesystem path for
     the directory and domain(s) specified by the state value returned by
     sysdir_start_search_path_enumeration().  Subsequent calls to
     sysdir_get_next_search_path_enumeration() should pass the state value
     returned by the previous call to continue the enumeration in each domain.
     A state value of zero will be returned when all domains have been
     enumerated.

     The path buffer that is passed to
     sysdir_get_next_search_path_enumeration() will be filled with a null-
     terminated string, possibly containing as many as PATH_MAX-1 characters.

     Some directory paths returned may not exist on the filesystem.

     Some combinations of dir and domainMask may return no directory paths.

     Directory paths returned in the user domain will contain "~" to refer to
     the user's directory.

     The environment variable NEXT_ROOT is prepended as necessary to the
     returned directory paths.  NEXT_ROOT is ignored if the process is setuid
     or is code signed with entitlements.

                                      default, although it can be put

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variable affects the execution of
     sysdir_get_next_search_path_enumeration:

     NEXT_ROOT  If the NEXT_ROOT environment variable is set and the current
                process is not tainted by uid or gid changes, NEXT_ROOT is
                prepended as necessary to the returned directory paths.
                NEXT_ROOT is ignored if the process is setuid or is code
                signed with entitlements.

EXAMPLES
     #include <limits.h>
     #include <sysdir.h>

     char path[PATH_MAX];
     sysdir_search_path_enumeration_state state = sysdir_start_search_path_enumeration(dir, domainMask);
     while ( (state = sysdir_get_next_search_path_enumeration(state, path)) != 0 ) {
         // Handle directory path
     }

HISTORY
     The sysdir API first appeared in OS X 10.12, iOS 10, watchOS 3 and tvOS
     10 replacing the deprecated NSSystemDirectories(3) API.
